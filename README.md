# Stretch app by Maximus
This is a stretch app where you can gather all your diffrent routines for stretching exercieses. As of my daily routine I stretch everyday. The problem for me though is that I get a paper handed to me every week with a updated version of the program. To save me some headaches I want to automate this in which I can enter my stretch program into the app when I recive it at keep track of it from there. The main purpose of being simple.

## Goals when developing the app
The goal for me is to develop a app which is used by real users. This forces me to design the app with extra tought and learn to implement functionallity which actually benefit the user experience.
On top of this I will develop the backend in TDD.
